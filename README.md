# Naive-Bayes-Algorithm

This project provides a Naïve-Bayes library/API that supports various functionalities, including data loading, dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. The library is designed to work with different types of data files (CSV, txt, etc.), and offers a flexible, iterative approach to model evaluation.

## 📄 Features
- Data Loading
  Load data files (CSV, txt, etc.) into memory for processing.

- Dataset Creation
  Generate training and testing datasets with uniform random selection.

- Naïve-Bayes Model
  Implement a Naïve-Bayes classifier to make predictions based on training data.
  
- Model Evaluation
  Evaluate the model’s performance using a test dataset.
